Food Image Classification Pipeline Overview
This project demonstrates a process for classifying food images using pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Model Hub. The pipeline includes searching for suitable models, loading and displaying an image, using a model to classify the image, and saving and reloading the model for future use.

High-Level Steps
Importing Libraries:

Essential libraries for image processing, model handling, and logging are imported. This ensures smooth functionality and reduces unnecessary log output.
Helper Function:

A helper function is defined to convert images to RGB format, ensuring compatibility with the classification model.
Loading and Displaying the Image:

The specified image is loaded from the local directory and displayed using matplotlib to verify the correct image is being processed.
Searching for Models:

The Hugging Face Hub API is used to search for image classification models related to food categories. The search criteria are dynamic and can be adjusted based on different tags and parameters.
Creating the Classification Pipeline:

An image classification pipeline is initialized using the selected pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Hub.
Saving the Model Locally:

The pre-trained model is saved to a specified local directory. This allows for efficient reuse without needing to re-download the model.
Classifying the Image:

The pipeline is used to classify the loaded image, and the label with the highest confidence score is identified and printed.
Purpose and Usage
Purpose: The pipeline aims to provide a streamlined method for classifying food images using state-of-the-art pre-trained models. This can be useful for applications in food recognition, dietary tracking, and culinary content categorization.

Usage: Users can follow the provided steps to set up the pipeline, customize the search criteria for models, and classify their own food images. The ability to save and reload models enhances efficiency, especially for repeated tasks.
